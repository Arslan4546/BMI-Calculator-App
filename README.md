# BMI Calculator App

The BMI Calculator is a user-friendly app designed to help you calculate your Body Mass Index (BMI) easily. Built using the Flutter framework, this app is available on both Android and iOS platforms. The app features a straightforward and easy-to-use interface, making it accessible to users of all ages. Simply enter your weight (in kg) and height (in cm) to instantly find out your BMI. The app provides accurate results based on your input values.

Along with your BMI result, the app indicates the BMI category you fall into (Underweight, Normal weight, Overweight, or Obese) and provides basic health guidance. You can enter weight and height in different units (kgs/lbs and cm/inches), and the app automatically converts and provides accurate results. The app features an interactive design with smooth animations and transitions to enhance the user experience.
